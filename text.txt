### custom modules used
- `crater_preprocessing.py`
- `crater_loader.py`
- `crater_data.py`: classes for data management. Similar to tensorflows datasets
- `crater_cnn.py`: the class for CNN implementation
- `crater_nn.py`: the class for NN implementation
- `network_blocks.py`: some methods to build CNN structure
- `crater_plots.py`: some methods to display plots from CNN
- `helper.py`: some miscelaneous helper functions

### scripts for experiment
- `train_cnn.py`: for model training. It generates a files that can be loaded
- `training_nn.py`: for model training. It generates a files that can be loaded
- `sliding_window_2networks.py`: loads both models and perform crater detection while sliding through the image
- `remove_duplicates.py`: processes csv outputs from sliding. Removes duplicated detections

### example code
- `use_trained_model.py`
- `visualize_rectangles.py`
- `crater_slice_window.py`
- `xmeans.py`
